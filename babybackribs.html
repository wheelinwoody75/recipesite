              <p><font size="5">Have y'all seen the price of a full rack at Chili's lately?
                  It's completely insane considering how many unedible bones you have to pay for.  
                  This recipe is designed to make the same great ribs at home, wihout a smoker (You think Chili's smokes their ribs?)
                  at a much more respectable cost per plate.
