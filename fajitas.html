              <p><font size="5">Kids, ya'll come gather round the time machine called "Old Man's Memories" and let me tell you
                                a story about my escuela secondaria profesor de español.  His name was Señior Mac and he was the most take-no-sh*t teacher I had in school,
                                but he made some awesome fajitas.  As legend had it, Señior Mac spent his youth in the Peace Corps teaching Spanish language classes
                                in Central America.  It was during his time in Costa Rica that some friends had shown him this fajita recipe. What Señior Mac learned there,
                                he brought with him to teach others. These fajitas were so good, he was able to use them as a fund rasier to take a group of students to Costa Rica
                                every year over spring break.  

                                It's a simple recipe that honeslty takes more waiting that cooking, but it's completely worth it.
